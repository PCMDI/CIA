# CIA

No, not that CIA.  This repository is used to maintain the Common Input Arguments (CIA) that are used for independently developed analysis used to evaluate General Circulation Models (GCMs) or Earth System Models (ESMs). 

Purpose:  Many modeling centers are interested in using multiple externally developed analysis packages.  They and other potential users will experience substantial benefit if these packages can be operated at least somewhat similiarly.  The common input options provided by the CIA offer a default or starting point which can easily be modified or appended as needed by specific capabilities.  

Maintainance: The CIA is maintained by a small team motivated to help advance the interoperability of different analysis capabilities.  Anyone interested in contributing to the development of the CIA sould contact ....
