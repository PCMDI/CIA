# CIA

No, not that CIA.  This repository is used to maintain the Common Input Arguments (CIA) that are used for independently developed General Circulation Model (GCM) or Earth System Model (ESM) analysis capabilities. 

Purpose:  Many modeling centers are interested in using multiple externally developed analysis packages.  They and other potential users will experience substantial benefit if these packages can be operated at least somewhat similiarly.  The common input options provided by the CIA offer a default or starting point which can easily be modified or appended as needed by specific capabilities.  


Maintainance: The CIA is maintained by a small team motivated to help andvance the interoperability of different analysis capabilities.  Interested parties   


odifications are made via a python script .  The actual defaults and thier options are stored in a json file in the src directory.   This file will be maintained
